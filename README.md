# control-my-lights
 This Discord bot will let you control my lights. Why would I want to give other people access to my lights? I think this is a bad Idea...
 
 Welp an upgrade later. This bot can control ALL my lights. Yea. ALL. Slightly scarier, but no one abuses it so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

 LiteBot is available in The Factory&trade; (Not really trademarked lol), Faker's Left Nut(Jonathan's server) or the public LiteBot server. Server Invite: https://discord.gg/WVXz9CmFbt. 
 To use my lights: Make sure that you go to #unreal ppl and tell me who you are. Also pleeeeease do not use it between 12 AM and 6 AM (I live in California)(unless you are in a call with me and you know for sure that I am well awake(me being online doesnt count)). Lites wont work in unreal ppl.

 
 Also even though I could not make Tasmota work on my new device, If you have a smart device use [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/). If Tasmota does not work, use [TuyaAPI](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi). Tasmota keeps things local so I prefer that. [DigiBlur](https://www.youtube.com/c/digiblurDIY/) has a lot of good stuff on youtube, and if you join his discord(not to be confused with the discord listed above) you can get lots of help and resources to make your smart home experience better.
