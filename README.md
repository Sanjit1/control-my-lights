# control-my-lights
 This Discord bot will let you control my lights. Why the fuck would I want to give other people access to my lights? I think this is a bad Idea...
 
 Welp an upgrade later. This bot can control ALL my lights. Yea. ALL. Slightly scarier, but no one abuses it so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

 Server Invite: https://discord.gg/WVXz9CmFbt. After joining you need to dm me, sifu shrimp, your name on Discord(if I know you), and ill make you a real person.
 
 Also even though I could not make Tasmota work on my new device, If you have a smart device use [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/). If Tasmota does not work, use [TuyaAPI](https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi). Tasmota keeps things local so I prefer that. [DigiBlur](https://www.youtube.com/c/digiblurDIY/) has a lot of good stuff on youtube, and if you join his discord(not to be confused with the discord listed above) you can get lots of help and resources to make your smart home experience better.
